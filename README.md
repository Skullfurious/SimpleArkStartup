## Simple Ark Startup

This project is a simple Ark Server startup script that is written in Python 3. It provides a dynamic difficulty option as well so you can have a bit more of a fluid experience over a period of time.

## Installation

First lets check and see if Python came pre-installed on your server.

```bash
python --version
```

If you get Python 3.8.10 or greater you should be good to go. Keep in mind that this script assumes your distribution is following the new guidelines of the official Ubuntu distribution and python3 is named python system wide. If you get an error run the following command:

```bash
apt-get install python-is-python3 -y
```
